Please put me through to the complaints department. The repair to the water main outside my 
house was unsuccessful, and my cellar's flooded. Your Water Services Department was singularly 
unsympathetic. All their repair teams are apparently booked out for the next two weeks. Am I 
supposed to use the cellar as a swimming pool till then?
