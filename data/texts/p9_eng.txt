I've always found it difficult to sleep on long train journeys in Britain. For one thing, I can never 
make myself comfortable in the seat. Then the other passengers usually talk so loudly, or worse still 
they snore. In addition, there's the constant clickety-click of the wheels on the track. If I do manage to 
doze off the ticket inspector comes along and wakes me.
