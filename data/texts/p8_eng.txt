Last night I opened the front door to let the cat out. It was such a beautiful evening that I 
wandered down the garden for a breath of fresh air. Then I heard a click as the door closed behind me. 
I realised I'd locked myself out. To cap it all, I was arrested while I was trying to force the door open!
