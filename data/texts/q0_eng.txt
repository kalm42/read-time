Sorry I didn't come to dinner at the weekend. I was really looking forward to seeing you again. 
Unfortunately I had a small accident just as I was getting ready to leave. It was when I went down to 
fetch a bottle of wine from the cellar. I didn't bother to switch the light on, tripped on a loose step in 
the dark, and broke my ankle.
