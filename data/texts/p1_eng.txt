We are enquiring into possible catering arrangements for a large meeting. We would need to 
have the food delivered to the premises in a manner that would allow immediate consumption. There 
are no facilities for setting out the food in a separate room. We were thinking of a selection of 
sandwiches, meats, cheeses, and fruit. Do you have special corporate rates for academic institutions?
