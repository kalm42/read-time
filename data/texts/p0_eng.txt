My wife has a complicated flight schedule next month. Would you please advise me on the most 
economical arrangements? She has a series of meetings, 9am to 5pm, in Paris, Bruges, Frankfurt, 
Rome, and Hamburg on consecutive days. Can you suggest convenient evening flights and suitable 
accomodation? She doesn't like large, anonymous hotels.
